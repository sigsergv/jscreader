	An AID consists of a registered application provider identifier (RID) of five bytes, which is
	issued by the ISO/IEC 7816-5 registration authority. This is followed by a proprietary application
	identifier extension (PIX), which enables the application provider to differentiate among the
	different applications offered. Â© Wikipedia

	Each "application" node has required attribute "aid" that contains AID value (byte values could be separated
	by any number of optional spaces). "type" attribute is required too and should contain one of the following
	values: "emv", "unknown", TBC.
